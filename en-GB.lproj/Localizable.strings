It has a margin of error of only about 5%.\n\nTo calculate the calorie intake for weight loss, a calorie deficit of 20% is used with an adjustment of the proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.\nAnd for weight gain, respectively, a calorie surplus of 20% with an adjustment in the proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. \n\nIt is also worth considering that the formula assumes use for adults from 18 to 80 years old, with a height of 140-200 cm, and a weight of 50 to 150 kg.";
