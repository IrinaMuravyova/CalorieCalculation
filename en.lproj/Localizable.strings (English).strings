The Harris-Benedict formula, the most popular worldwide, is used to calculate the level of basal metabolism and determine the necessary calories.

The formula was derived by American physiologist Francis Gano Benedict and botanist James Arthur Harris at the beginning of the last century, but still remains relevant. It has a margin of error of only about 5%.

To calculate the calorie intake for weight loss, a calorie deficit of 20% is used with an adjustment of the proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
And for weight gain, respectively, a calorie surplus of 20% with an adjustment in the proportions of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
